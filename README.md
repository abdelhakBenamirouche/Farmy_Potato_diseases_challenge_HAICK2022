# Farmy_Potato_diseases_challenge_HAICK2022

The objective is to train an image classification model able to perform well in production. For this reason, we extracted test data from the Farmy production data. Images included are submitted by farmers using the Farmy app. We selected the potato crop with two diseases (Early blight, Late blight) and a healthy class. We expect that participants train their classifiers on available data such as academic datasets and images available on the internet in order to improve the F-score on the test images provided by Farmy.
